## [Unreleased]

### Added

- Initial repository governance, contribution guidance, security policy, code of conduct, and
  support documents, adapted from the sibling Arbitraitor repository for Orchestraitor's
  spec-driven, security-first workflow.
- Root [`AGENTS.md`](AGENTS.md) with always-active project rules: Arbitraitor as the exclusive
  security authority (spec §2.2, §16), spec as source of truth, engineering priorities, scope
  and GitHub workflow, review/merge invariants, documentation, testing, and Rust conventions.
- Dual `MIT OR Apache-2.0` licensing, matching Arbitraitor.
- `.github/` scaffolding: `CODEOWNERS`, `dependabot.yml`, issue templates
  (`bug.yml`, `feature.yml`, `task.yml`, `spike.yml`, `config.yml`), a pull-request template
  with stable machine-readable checklist markers, and a workflows `README.md` documenting the
  intended CI layout once application code exists.
- `.agents/project/orchestraitor-workflow.md` project workflow policy: MVP-only scheduling,
  security-first review requirements, Arbitraitor ownership boundaries, cross-repository
  blocker handling, required review domains, documentation and testing expectations, and PR
  convergence requirements.
- `.agents/project/github-project.example.toml` example GitHub Project configuration
  (resolves mutable node IDs at runtime; commits only human-readable names).
- Two reusable Agent Skills under `.agents/skills/`:
  `github-project-workflow` (triage, decomposition, ready-queue, claims, reconciliation) and
  `github-pr-lifecycle` (draft PR, CI inspection, adversarial review convergence, merge
  eligibility, post-merge reconciliation), each with `references/` and composable `scripts/`.

### Fixed

- `orchestraitor-core` now merges dynamic configuration table entries field-by-field, includes
  structured error causes and source chains, and omits sensitive tracing fields entirely.
- `orchestraitor-provider-meta` now falls through corrupt or unreadable cache snapshots to the
  bundled `models.dev` catalog when the live endpoint is unavailable.
